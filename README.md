# UNSW Graphics

This library is being written as part of the Computer Graphics course at UNSW.

The project is set up as an eclipse project, so can be imported via the import option *Existing Projects into Workspace*.

## Additional notes

As it is intended for educational purposes, this library is missing many desirable features and optimisations. It prioritises clarity and simplicity over all other considerations.
